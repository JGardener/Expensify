  Line 4 adds a base tag. 
  The <base> tag specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URL's in a document. 
  In this case, it is our entire React App, as everything runs from index.html
  There can only be one base tag, and it sits inside the <head> element. 

  So, why did this get added?

  Simply put, in AppRouter.js, I altered:

  path="/edit" 
  to
  path="/edit:id"

  this means that dynamic URL's are now possible on the edit page. 
  However, the app was unable to find any of them, 404 errors were returning. 
  The reason the base tag fixes it is because without it, the app will try 
  to use the defined path as the base url. In our case - path="/edit:id" - would be the 
  base url, which is wrong! The base tag corrects this :)
